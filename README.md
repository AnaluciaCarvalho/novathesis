unlthesis
=========

A LaTeX template for MSc and PhD thesis from Universidade Nova de Lisboa.

About
-----

This template was developed targeting the students from the MSc and PhD programs at DI-FCT-UNL (1).

The LaTeX template is highly configurable and fits the requirements of other students at FCT-UNL with no changes at all. It should be easy to tweak the configuration parameters and make it fit for other institutions as well.

There is a folter with the Word template that is... well... is a Word document... with all associated the good and bad things. ;)
